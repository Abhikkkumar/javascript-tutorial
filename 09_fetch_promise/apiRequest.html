    <!-- The XMLHttpRequest.readyState property returns the state an
    XMLHttpRequest client is in. An XHR client exists in one of the following
    states: 
    1. UNSENT The XMLHttpRequest client has been created, but the open()
    method hasn't been called yet. 
    2. OPENED open() method has been invoked.
    During this state, the request headers can be set using the
    setRequestHeader() method and the send() method can be called which will
    initiate the fetch. 
    3. HEADERS_RECEIVED send() has been called, all redirects (if any) have been followed and the response headers have been
    received. 
    4. LOADING Response's body is being received. If responseType is "text" or empty string, responseText will have the partial text response as
    it loads. 
    5.DONE The fetch operation is complete. This could mean that
    either the data transfer has been completed successfully or failed.  -->
